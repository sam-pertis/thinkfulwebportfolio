        <h3><u>About me:</u></h3>
        <p>My name is Samantha Pertis, currently a student in the Thinkful bootcamp, aspiring to be a software engineer. I am currently located in Port St. Lucie, FL, and am looking to relocate to Cleveland, OH. I have been a music teacher for many years of my life, but always had a deep interest in being a part of the IT world, which I hope Thinkful will help me be a successful part of.
When I'm not studying or working on school, I love to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cook</li>
          <li>Do ALL things music related</li>
          <li>Play video games</li>
          <li>Skateboard</li>
          <li>and play Magic the Gathering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope that you will consider me to be a part of your team! You will find a dedicated problem-solver who is eager to learn something new every day, improve upon my skills, and find new and exciting ways to offer you the best services possible!<br>
Thanks again for browsing my website!
